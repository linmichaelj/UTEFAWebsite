	<h1>Company Analyses</h1>			
	<p>Here are a few examples of some companies we have analyzed in the past. These powerpoints provide a company's general description, key drivers, and overall trends - all from a qualitative perspective. We also take into account any major macroeconomical factors that can affect the company's industry. The presentations conclude with a buy/hold/ignore decision based on both the qualitative and quantitative (DCF) factors. If the decision is to buy/hold, an appropriate buy-in price is estimated based on the company's DCF evaluation.

	<h1>Discounted Cash Flow Analyses</h1>			
	<p>Our DCF Analyses are performed through a complex Excel spreadsheet. By looking at a company's previous financial statements, as well as a few financial ratios, we can forecast their future growth and estimate a suggested stock price. Using this evaluation method combined with our qualitative analyses, we initiate an informed investment decision.
