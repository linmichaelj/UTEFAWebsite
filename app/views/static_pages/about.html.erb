	<h1>About Us</h1>				
	<p>The Engineering Finance Association was formed in 2009, with Professor Lawryshyn and the founding members realizing the demand in financial knowledge from engineering students. The passion in investing and financial markets from our dedicated members have been the key driver to the club's growth today. By working closely with student members, we were able to deliver the quality education and investment performance.  In 2012-2013, our team aims to bring out the best efforts yet, to continue our strive for our passion in the financial markets.</p>
